    "\n",
    "With logistic regression, we model the **probability** of success for each individual observation (in a **binary** classification problem, this is simply the probability that each individual observation belongs to a given class). We use the [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) to model the output as a linear combination of the inputs while ensuring that it is still bound between 0 and 1. We can denote logistic regression as follows: \n",
