    "# A Shallow Neural Network with Non-Linear Activations\n",
    "\n",
    "Last notebook, we looked at a feedforward, fully-connected neural network with one hidden layer where each node's activation was the identity function. We discovered that this was really just simple linear regression, and suggested that the real power of a neural network would come with the use of non-linear activation functions. We'll now examine that claim by using the sigmoid activation that we used during logistic regression...\n",

    "If we take our [computational graph](https://github.com/sallamander/neural-networks-intro/blob/master/mini-books/shallow-neural-networks/imgs/custom/shallow_linear_connect.png?raw=true) from last notebook and simply replace the activations in the hidden layer with sigmoid activations, our computational graph becomes the following:\n",

    "As we've done with linear and logistic regression, we then solve for the weights through gradient descent.

    "Before diving into gradient descent, we'll make one notational change.

We'll do the same here, but we have to factor in the fact that there are multiple nodes receiving inputs. To account for this, we'll use a *subscript* as well as a *superscript* with each \n",
