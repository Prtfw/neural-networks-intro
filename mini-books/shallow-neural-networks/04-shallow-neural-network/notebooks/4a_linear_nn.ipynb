    "We'll create our first neural network by revisiting our computational graph for simple linear regression, but add in a new layer. In addition to having an input and output layer, we'll have a layer in between (a **hidden layer**). If we *ignore the connectivity* of the graph for a second, we can visualize it as follows: \n",

    "The only real difference between this computational graph and the one we looked at for simple linear regression is the addition of the **hidden layer**. While there are differing opinions as to why the middle layer is called a **hidden layer** (which we won't get into), we'll define a **hidden layer** to be any layer that is not the input or output layer. The presence of a hidden layer is what we'll treat as defining a *true* neural network, such that we're now viewing our first *true* neural network. Traditionally, a neural network with only one hidden layer has been referred to as a **shallow** neural network, as opposed to a **deep** neural network that has two or more hidden layers. \n",

    "Let's now build in the connectivity. We'll read the graph from left to right, and assume that every node in one layer is connected to every node in the subsequent layer (reading left to right), but no nodes in prior layers. We'll also add in an intercept term for each node in the hidden and output layers. In our graph, we'll represent connections with lines , and each connection will have an associated **weight** (except for the intercepts, whose weights will simply be `1`). Adding all of this in, our computational graph becomes the following:\n",

We often refer to a neural network where these properties are true as a **feedforward, fully-connected** neural network, where the **feedforward** part refers to the former property and the **fully-connected** part the latter. Here, we have only one node in Layer 1, but we could have many (we've chosen one so that it's easy to visualize the functions we'll model later on). We could similarly have more than 2 nodes in the hidden layer, and more than 1 in the output layer. Neural networks are extremely flexible and extensible. \n",

While it might be the case that this neural network can more readily pick up interactions between features than standard simple linear regression, we still don't gain that much predictive power when we build a neural network using exclusively *identity* activations. The real power comes when we build a neural network with primarily non-linear activations, which we'll do in the next notebook!"
